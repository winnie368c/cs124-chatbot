        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mNice to meet you, I'm Bot-tholomew Mouse! Tell me about a movie you watched so I can make some recommendations for you!

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mHmm, I didn't hear you say a movie title. Put the title between double quotation marks. Tell me about a movie you've watched.

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mI didn't catch you mentioning a movie. Put the title between double quotation marks, please. What's your opinion on a movie you've seen recently?
