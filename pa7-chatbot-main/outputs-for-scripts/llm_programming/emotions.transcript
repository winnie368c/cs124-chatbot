        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mNice to meet you, I'm Bot-tholomew Mouse! Tell me about a movie you watched so I can make some recommendations for you!
> I am sad.

['sadness']
[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mI'm sorry to hear that you're feeling sad. Cheer up, better days are ahead! Sorry, I can only talk about movies right now. Make sure to put the title between double quotation marks. Tell me about a movie you've seen recently.
> I am happy.

['happiness']
[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mI'm so glad you're feeling happiness! It's wonderful to share in your joy. Sorry, I can only talk about movies right now. Make sure to put the title between double quotation marks. Tell me about a movie you've seen recently.
> I am angry.

['anger\\n']
[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mI can tell you're feeling angry. Let's try to find a solution together, okay, pal? I didn't catch you mentioning a movie. Put the title between double quotation marks, please. What's your opinion on a movie you've seen recently?
> :quit

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mOkay, see you later!
