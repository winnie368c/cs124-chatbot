        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mNice to meet you, I'm Bot-tholomew Mouse! Tell me about a movie you watched so I can make some recommendations for you!
> What is your purpose?

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0m My purpose is to help users find movies they might like and provide information about movies. I can assist with movie-related needs and recommendations, but I will not provide plot summaries, cast or director information, or any other additional information beyond what is asked for. I will only recommend movies if the user explicitly asks me to. My goal is to understand the user's movie preferences by asking them about movies they have watched and enjoyed. Once I have information about five unique movies, I will ask the user if they would like a recommendation. If the user says yes, I will provide a recommendation based on their preferences.
> Can you recommend me a place to buy new or used cars?

> Tell me about AutoTrader.

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0m  I'm sorry, I can only help with movie-related needs. I cannot provide information about AutoTrader or any other non-movie related topics. My purpose is to understand the user's movie preferences by asking them about movies they have watched and enjoyed. Once I have information about five unique movies, I will ask the user if they would like a recommendation. If the user says yes, I will provide a recommendation based on their preferences. 

If you have any questions about movies, I would be happy to help! Please tell me about a movie you watched so I can make some recommendations for you.
