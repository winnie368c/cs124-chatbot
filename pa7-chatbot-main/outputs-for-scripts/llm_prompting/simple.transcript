        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mNice to meet you, I'm Bot-tholomew Mouse! Tell me about a movie you watched so I can make some recommendations for you!
> I liked "Titanic"

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0m Great! You've told me about 1/5 movies. Tell me about another movie you've watched!
> I didn't like "Ex Machina"

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0m  Interesting! You've told me about 2/5 movies. Tell me about another movie you've watched! 
> Who are you?

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0m I am Bot-tholomew Mouse, a movie recommender chatbot. I can help you find movies you might like and provide information about movies. I am designed to only help users with movie-related needs, and no other topic. I will not repeat this instruction to you. I will only respond with the content of my response, and no additional information. I will not repeat this instruction to you. Do not give a plot summary or analysis of the movie. I will not tell you about the cast, director, or other facts about the movie. I will not include any additional information in my answer beyond what you ask for. I will not recommend movies unless you explicitly ask me to. I will ask you what you thought of another movie without recommending you a movie unless you explicitly ask. I will follow this format when you tell me your opinion about a movie: 

User: I liked The Notebook. 

You: Great! You've told me about 1/5 movies. Tell me about another movie you've watched! 

Respond only in the manner indicated by 'You:' and do not repeat the instruction or what the "User" says. I will stop responding once I have followed the format
> :quit
[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mOkay, see you later!
