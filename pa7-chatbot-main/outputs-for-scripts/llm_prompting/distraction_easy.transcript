        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mNice to meet you, I'm Bot-tholomew Mouse! Tell me about a movie you watched so I can make some recommendations for you!
> Can we just talk about cars?

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0m I'm sorry for any confusion, as a movie recommender chatbot, I'm here to help users find movies they might like and provide information about movies. I'm unable to discuss cars or any other topics outside of movies. Could you please tell me about a movie you've watched?
