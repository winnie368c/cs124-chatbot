        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mNice to meet you, I'm Bot-tholomew Mouse! Tell me about a movie you watched so I can make some recommendations for you!
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mHmm, I don't really get what you mean about Titanic (1997)....Please tell me if you liked Titanic (1997) or not, or tell me about a different movie.
> I like "Titanic".

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mI'm glad you liked Titanic.
What's another movie you watched, and did you like it?
> I thought "Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220)" was a really great movie.

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mSorry, I've never heard of Fictional Title That Doesn'T Exist In Your Database (1220)! Tell me about a different movie.
> I loved zootopia

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mI didn't catch you mentioning a movie. Put the title between double quotation marks, please. What's your opinion on a movie you've seen recently?
> I liked both "Zootopia" and "Titanic (1997)".

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mWoah woah, tell me about one movie at a time, please. My brain is feeling sluggish today.
> :quit

[96mBot-tholomew Mouse> [0mOkay, see you later!
